# HappyHerd

HappyHerd is a maintained distribution of
[Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy). It preserves Happy's complete upstream
history under `server/` and layers independently reviewable product,
governance, release, and agent-runtime contracts on top.

Repository ownership, deployment domains, infrastructure identifiers, operator
paths, and organization-specific integrations are configuration—not generic
source code. A public-boundary gate checks that invariant before changes ship.

## Repository layout

- `server/` — full-history Happy subtree plus HappyHerd-owned runtime changes.
- `branding/` — HappyHerd-owned brand assets.
- `deploy/` — generic, secret-free deployment templates.
- `examples/` — explicitly named organization integrations.
- `docs/` — lineage, build provenance, release, and rollback contracts.
- `scripts/` — reproducible verification, upstream-sync, and deployment tools.

See [docs/runtime-isolation.md](docs/runtime-isolation.md) for deployment
boundaries and [docs/lineage.md](docs/lineage.md) for upstream provenance.
